# [WIP] Central repository for work on libp2p

This repository is the central place for rust development of the
[libp2p](https://libp2p.io) spec.

This readme along with many others will be more fleshed out the closer
the project gets to completion. Right now everything including the crate
organization is very much Work in Progress.
